## Project Objectives

Data Collection: Obtain reliable COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data.
Data Loading & Exploration: Load the dataset, explore its structure, and filter countries of interest.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and convert date to datetime.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate descriptive statistics and explore trends using line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Visualizing Vaccination Progress: Analyze vaccination rollouts with line charts and pie charts.
Optional: Build a Choropleth Map: Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.
Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)
Data Collection:

## Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv().

Filter countries of interest and drop missing values.
Convert date column to datetime.
Data Loading & Exploration:

## Check columns and preview rows.

Clean data by handling missing numeric values and dropping irrelevant columns.
Data Cleaning:

## Fill missing numeric values with fillna() or interpolate().

Drop columns that are not relevant for the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

## Plot total cases, deaths, and new cases over time.

Calculate death rate.
Visualizing Vaccination Progress:

## Plot cumulative vaccinations over time with line charts.

Compare % vaccinated population with pie charts.
Optional: Build a Choropleth Map:

## Prepare data for choropleth maps using geopandas.

Visualize case density or vaccination rates on a world map.

## Recommended Tools
Jupyter Notebook: For coding and interactive visualizations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib & seaborn: For creating line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Plotly Express: For creating choropleth maps.
geopandas: For advanced geospatial data handling (optional).
